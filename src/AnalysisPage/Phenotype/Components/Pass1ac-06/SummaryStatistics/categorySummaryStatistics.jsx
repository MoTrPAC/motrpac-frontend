      <h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        In this section, various summary statistics and visualizations that
        explore key variables across the phenotypic data are presented. The
        analysis covers weight distribution, electric shocks (both number
        and duration), distance covered during the acute test, and lactate
        changes due to exercise. Each variable is visualized through a
        combination of boxplots, histograms, and density plots, broken down
        by relevant factors such as sex, phase, and intervention group.
        Additionally, we analyze the time taken to freeze tissues, including
        comparisons across different groups and a detailed look at the order
        in which tissues were frozen for each animal. These visualizations
        help to identify patterns and trends within the phenotypic data.
